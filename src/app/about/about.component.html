    <h2>Karthik Ravi</h2>
    <p>He is one of the most outstanding Cricket statisticians of modern time, with his unique style of presenting Cricket facts and figures. His mastery across various media platforms – electronic, print, LIVE TV production – is mindboggling. Ever since he joined the editorial team, Rajneesh has played an important part in the site’s popularity with his in-depth analysis and superior research. His role requires him to keep a tab on each and every development in all formats of the game; but he has no qualms in admitting that it is the shortest version of Cricket that fascinates him the most.</p>
